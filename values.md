### No Sections!

There are no sections in the lab sessions! you can join either session or both sessions each week. But I'd strongly recommend you to join both sessions to be able to prepare a fantastic portfolio for your team that will come in handy after this course or even after you graduate from McGill :tada:

***

### Attendance is not obligatory!

Your _physical_ presence in the lab sessions is not mandatory! But labs cannot be done individually! it would be best if you worked in a team.

### Flexibility for Quiz1

I have recently been informed that the department student society (ECSESS) is organizing an industry trip to Toronto which leaves in the early morning on the 21st, on the same date as Quiz1! To accommodate students who are joining this event I can distribute the grade of this quiz on other quizzes evenly! **If you are going to join this session, please let me know as soon as possible!**

### Have you joined ECSE 437 recently?



First of all welcome to ECSE 437 I hope you enjoy this class and start building a solid foundation for your future steps!

In this class, you are supposed to work on a project called team-portfolio in which you collaborate with (mostly) two other students to implement a DevOps pipeline for your project. Here are some important points that are worth mentioning:

* If you don't have a team please contact Sarvin ([sarvin.ghiasikhalehoghli@mail.mcgill.ca](mailto:sarvin.ghiasikhalehoghli@mail.mcgill.ca)), she will assign you to a team.
* Attendance is not mandatory for the tutorial sessions! you can join one or two sessions depending on the time you want to dedicate to your project.
* In each lab, you need to complete a learning journal that basically shows what you have learned in the lab, what challenges you have faced, and how you managed to resolve them.
* &#x20;The final project will be putting all the steps you have taken in the labs sessions, creating a 20-minute presentation, and explaining your main contributions in your report.
* If you want to earn 10 bonus points you have two options: 1) Booking one slot presentation from the available topics; 2) Creating an excellent learning journal and demonstrating significant contributions in each lab (this will be evaluated by the TA)
* All quizzes contain short answer questions and will be held at the beginning of the class. So, please don't be late!
