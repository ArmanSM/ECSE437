### #1

There are no sections in the lab sessions! you can join either session or both sessions each week. But I'd strongly recommend you to join both sessions to be able to prepare a fantastic portfolio for your team that will come in handy after this course or even after you graduate from McGill :tada:

### #2

Your presence in the lab sessions is not mandatory! But labs cannot be done individually! it would be best if you worked in a team.

I have recently been informed that the department student society (ECSESS) is organizing an industry trip to Toronto which leaves in the early morning on the 21st, on the same date as Quiz1! To accommodate students who are joining this event I can distribute the grade of this quiz on other quizzes evenly! **If you are going to join this session, please let me know as soon as possible!**
