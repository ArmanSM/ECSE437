<summary>ðŸš€ Integrity</summary>

As an undergraduate student, you will have many assignments, papers, laboratory reports and/or presentations to prepare over the course of your studies. You may also become involved in peer or public education, go on to do graduate studies, or become a teaching assistant (TA) for undergraduate courses.

As such, academic integrity may apply to you not only as a student, but potentially in these other roles as well. During your time at McGill, you may encounter the following scenarios that raise questions about academic integrity. For each, we indicate if it involves a violation of the _Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (the Code)_, the specific article of the Code that is violated, an explanation of what constitutes a particular offence, how a TA or instructor can prevent similar situations from occurring and the immediate consequences. The penalties for a violation of the Code are listed in the [Policies on Student Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/policies-student-rights-and-responsibilities). **Take the time to review the range of possible sanctions for a violation of the Code.**

<summary>âœŠ Honesty</summary>

Academic integrity is of vital importance to any serious educational institution. The art of scholarship demands a rigid insistence on giving credit where credit is due, and any failure to do so undermines not only the value of honest students' work, but also the academic integrity of the University and the value of a McGill degree.

This site provides [resources](https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/publications/) that can help students [avoid dishonest work](https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/students/test) and the [disciplinary measures](https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/students) that go with it, as well as useful information for [teaching staff](https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/staff/).&#x20;

<summary>ðŸ’ª Equity, Diversity &#x26; Inclusion</summary>

Universities across Canada are presently called upon to recognize and address historical and contemporary forces that result in social inequities in postsecondary contexts. Many such forces have their roots in ideologies and practices â€“ such as colonialism, slavery, and patriarchy. Although these ideologies and practices no longer reflect McGillâ€™s values, their harmful effects persist. As such, our institutional commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) must acknowledge and seek to address the lasting effects of historic injustices that continue to challenge equal opportunities to access, and to succeed within, the McGill community. Our EDI commitments must also be inspired by the recognition that excellence is fostered by bringing together individuals and groups of diverse experiences, identities, and ideas. This Strategic EDI Plan for McGill seeks to act on this commitment through the articulation of specific goals, and measures for their achievement, over the next five years. Over this period, McGill will embed EDI in all core areas of the University, drawing on multiple strategic University-level documents initiated by McGillâ€™s Principal and Provost over the last decade.
